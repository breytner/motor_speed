## DC motor speed PID control system

This repository is organized as follows: 
* motor_speed/
    * de_controller/  &rarr; digital executable specification
    * tdf_controller/  &rarr; analog TDF model
    * lsf_controller/  &rarr; analog LSF model
    * eln_controller/  &rarr; analog ELN model
* tlm_iss_motor/  &rarr; TLM model with RISC-V ISS
* tlm_qemu_rabiits_motor/  &rarr; TLM model with RISC-V QEMU encapsulated by RABBITS

Inside each folder you will find dependencies information and execution instructions.
